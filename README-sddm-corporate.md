## Synopsis

Of all the SDDM Greeter Themes, SDDM-SUGAR-DARK by Marian Arlt upgraded as SDDM-ASTRONAUT by Keyitdev is, by a wide margin, the most capable. SDDM-CORPORATE is essentially SDDM-ASTRONAUT with some minor configuration changes.

## Objective

Preserve all the functionality SDDM-ASTRONAUT, while eliding thematic elements, and thus provide the user with a stripped down, plain vanilla, configuration ready for customization suitable in a corporate environment. Just replace the background containing the IBM Logo with your own theme or corporation's company logo.

The changes are cosmetic, and include:

- More colorful System Icons

- Larger and more colorful user name and password field icons

- Additional date format: "dddd MMMM d" -> "Thursday September 11th 2025"

## Files Modified Include

- Themes/corporate.conf

- Components/Input.qml

- Components/Clock.qml

- Assets-Original (Copy of Original Icons)

- Assets-Corporate (New Icons)

- Assets (Copy of New Icons)

- sddm-corporate.patch
