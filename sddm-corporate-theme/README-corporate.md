## Synopsis

Of all the SDDM Greeter Themes, SDDM-SUGAR-DARK by Marian Arlt upgraded as SDDM-ASTRONAUT by Keyitdev is, by a wide margin, the most capable. SDDM-CORPORATE is essentially SDDM-ASTRONAUT with some minor configuration changes.

## Objective

What's so special about SDDM-CORPORATE? Nothing. It doesn't even have its own pretty scenery, but preserves the functionality SDDM-ASTRONAUT, while adding minor cosmetic improvements. It's a stripped down, plain vanilla, configuration.

Just provide a background image matching your display's resolution and place it in the Backgrounds directory, or select one of the background images provided with SDDM-ASTRONAUT. If you elect to create your own background, the top fourth and lateral two-thirds of the screen are available and unobstructed.

The changes are cosmetic, and include:

<ul>
<li>More colorful System Icons</li>
<li>Larger and more colorful user name and password field icons</li>
<li>Additional date format: "dddd MMMM d" -> "Thursday September 11th 2025"</li>
</ul>
